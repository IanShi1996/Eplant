<p>ePlant combines new and familiar biological data visualization tools into a single portal that was designed to help researchers explore genes of interest from multiple layers of analysis. ePlant uses a zoomable user interface to help visualize the natural connections between DNA sequences, protein-protein interactions, cell and tissue expression patterns, natural variation, and proteomic responses to various experimental conditions. Dynamic links to the underlying data  and citation information is available on demand.

<p>Originally developed for the <a href="http://www.arabidopsis.org/portals/masc/IAIC.jsp">Arabidopsis Information Portal</a>, ePlant was built to be species agnostic. Please contact us if there is a particular species you would like to add. </p>

<p>ePlant was developed by <a href="http://www.waese.com">Jamie Waese</a>, Hans Yu, Asher Pasha and <a href="http://csb.utoronto.ca/faculty/provart-nicholas">Nicholas Provart</a> in the Department of Cell & Systems Biology at the University of Toronto. ePlant was funded with grants from Genome Canada and NSERC. This is a continuation of the original ePlant project by <a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/fetchObject.action?uri=info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0015237&representation=PDF">Fucile et al. (2011)</a>.</p>

<p>ePlant was designed to work with Firefox, Chrome and Safari. Some features do not work with Internet Explorer at this time.</p>
