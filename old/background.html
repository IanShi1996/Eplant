<h2>Background</h2>
<p>ePlant is an effort to leverage current thinking about data visualization and user experience design to help educators and researchers make sense of the ever growing volumes of publicly available data describing multiple levels of biological processes. ePlant connects to several web services to download the latest genome, proteome, metabolome, biochemical pathways, and tissue expression pattern data for any given gene.</p>

<p>The visualization tools in ePlant are presented with a conceptual hierarchy that progresses from big to small. We use a zoom metaphor to represent moving closer to- or further away from each level of analysis in the hopes that the temporal and spatial connection between layers will reveal conceptual connections as well. We recognize that each level of analysis is unique and arguments can be made for organizing the hierarchy in a different order. Future versions of ePlant will enable users to reorder the icons according to their personal preferences.</p>

<p>Some of ePlant's visualization tools are implementations of other tools you may be familiar with: <a href="http://cytoscape.github.io/cytoscape.js/">Cytoscape.js</a> for the protein interactions and reactome charts, <a href="http://wiki.jmol.org/index.php/Jmol_JavaScript_Object">JSmol</a> for the 3D molecular view, and <a href="http://jbrowse.org/">JBrowse</a> for the genome browser. Other visualization tools are based on the well known viewers developed at <a href="http://bar.utoronto.ca">bar.utoronto.ca</a>, particularly the eFP browsers for <a href="http://bar.utoronto.ca/cell_efp/cgi-bin/cell_efp.cgi">cells</a>, <a href="http://bar.utoronto.ca/efp/cgi-bin/efpWeb.cgi">tissues</a>, and <a href="http://bar.utoronto.ca/efp/cgi-bin/efpWeb.cgi?dataSource=Natural_Variation">natural variations</a>.</p>
